    "# Task: Take input from user and store in `.txt` file in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "The goal is to take input from the user through the console and save that input into a `.txt` file using Python. This process involves basic file handling and exception management using `try-except`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Use the `input()` function to collect input from the user.\n",
    "2. Use the `open()` function with mode `'w'` or `'a'` to open a file for writing (create or append).\n",
    "3. Use the `.write()` method to save the input to the file.\n",
    "4. Use `try-except` to catch and handle any errors during the file operation.\n",
    "5. Optionally, use a `with` block to ensure the file is automatically closed after writing.\n"
