-- ##############################
/*
	1. Constraints are like 'gate keepers'
	2. Controls the kind of data goes into the database
	3. Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on table
	4. These are used to prevent invalid data from being entered into the database.
	5. They ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database
	6. Constraints can be added on:
		- Table
		- Columns
	7. Column level constraints are applied only to one column
	Table level constraints are applied to the whole table
	
	8. Types of constraints:
		- NOT NULL: Field must have values
		- UNIQUE: Only unique values are allowed
		- DEFAULT: Ability to set DEFAULT values
		- PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table
		- FOREIGN KEY: Constrains data based on columns in other tables
		- CHECK: Checks all values meet specific criteria
